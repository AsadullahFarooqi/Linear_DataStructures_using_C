### Stack with C.
### Queue with C.
these functions are avalible in my code 
1. `length` function is for length of the list.
2. `print_list_normally_with_recur` function for display list normally with recursion.
3. `print_list_reversly_with_recur` function for only display list reversly with recursion.
4. `print_list_normally_with_iter` function for display list normally with iteration.
5. `insert_item_at_beg` to insert item at the begining of list.
6. `insert_item_at_end` to insert item at the end of list.
7. `insert_on_nth_position` to insert item at the nth position of list.
8. `del_from_beg` to delete item from the begining of the list.
9. `del_from_end` to delete item from the end of the list.
10. `del_by_val` to delete item by value.
11. `del_by_key` to delete item by key.
12. `reverse` to reverse list.
